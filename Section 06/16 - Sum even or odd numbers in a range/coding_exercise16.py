Coding Exercise 16 - Sum even or odd numbers in a range
In this coding exercise, you have to write a function named sum_eo with the following parameters:

n: a positive number
t: a str

If t has the value 'e', the function should return the sum of all even natural numbers less than n.
Else if t has the value 'o', the function should return the sum of all odd natural numbers less than n.
For any other values of t return -1.

Examples:
    1. sum_eo(10, 'e') should return 20, since 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
    2. sum_eo(7, 'o') should return 9, since 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
    3. sum_eo(11, 'spam') should return -1.
