Coding Exercise 17 - Fizz Buzz
For this exercise, you'll write a function that returns the next answer, in the game of fizz buzz.
It's a simple game, usually played with 2 or more people.
You start counting, in turn. That's easy enough, but there's a complication.
If the number is divided by 3, you say "fizz" instead.
If it's divisible by 5, you say "buzz".
And if it's divisible by both 3 and 5, you say "fizz buzz".

The function must be called fizz_buzz

You fizz_buzz function should return the correct word ("fizz", "buzz", or "fizz buzz"),
or the number if it's not divisible by either 3 or 5.

The function will always return a string. When you return the number, therefore, you should
convert it to a string first.

Remember to annotate your function, and include a Docstring.
Include a for loop, to test your function for values from 1 to 100, inclusive.
