Coding Exercise 22 - Difference
For this exercise, imagine you're working on a retail web site.
Customers can favorite certain items that they're interested in.
They can also purchase items, by adding them to their shopping basket - or cart.
As they browse the various items for sale, the web page will display a list of items that they might
be interested in purchasing. That list will be the items they've marked as "favourites".
But we don't want to suggest items that the customer has already added to their shopping basket.
The code to create the favorites and basket sets has already been written and tested.

Your task is to create a sorted list of the customer's favorite items, without any items that are in their basket.
