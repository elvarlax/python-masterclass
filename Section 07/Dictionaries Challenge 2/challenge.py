Section 7 Challenge - Dictionaries 2
We have mentioned that the data for the Adventure game could be organized in many different ways.
We've created another way for you. Your mission, if you choose to accept it,
is to change the code to make it work. Below is the complete program from the last video,
but with the locations dictionary modified so that everything is in a single dictionary.
N.B. Yes the code has some errors, that's what you need to fix!
